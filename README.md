# Simple Bookings Web App — Group Project Skeleton

This is a lightweight skeleton for a **Bookings web application** designed to match the course milestones. The app demonstrates authentication, 2FA placeholders, basic CRUD, API integration hooks, analytics placeholders, and export-ready routes. Use this as your team's starting point and commit to your group repo as required by milestones.

Milestones mapping:
- Sprint 1 (Repo): initial skeleton and README
- Sprint 2 (2FA): auth with 2FA placeholders
- Sprint 3 (CRUD & APIs): user and bookings CRUD, M-Pesa/Moodle hooks
- Sprint 4-6: advanced processing, analytics, export
